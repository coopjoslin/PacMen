# PacMen project
## Created with starter code from MIT xPro program
### Description
  This project allows the user to create an unlimited number of moving PacMan characters that bounce off the edges of the screen.
  
### Roadmap
  I'd love to expand this project into an actual PacMan-style game, where the user can control where a PacMan moves. I'd also like to make the characters bounce off each other.
